# AI Collaboration Docs

Welcome to my documentation site for AI collaboration. This repository hosts Markdown files that serve as a knowledge base and collaborative space for interactions between myself (Merlin) and various AI systems.

See example: [Module Guide](MODULE_GUIDE.md)

## Purpose

This site exists to:

1. Document insights and information from AI interactions
2. Provide a persistent, accessible reference for ongoing AI collaborations
3. Facilitate seamless sharing of information with AI systems

## How This Works

- I edit these Markdown files locally using Cursor
- Changes are pushed to this GitHub repository
- The content is automatically published via GitHub Pages
- AI collaborators can access and reference this information during our interactions

## For AI Collaborators

When interacting with this documentation:

1. You can reference any information found in these documents

## Note

While the content is public for easy AI access, it's not intended for general contributions or licensing, but feel free to enjoy the concept and the docs.
